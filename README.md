# CobaltStrike-BOF
Collection of beacon BOF written to learn windows and cobaltstrike


# 1 ) DCOM-Lateral-BOF.c
A quick PoC that uses ShellWindows for lateral movement. You will have to provide creds (username, password, and domain) on line 93-95 for it to work. If you wish to use the current user credentials, you can change line 110 to "authInfo->pAuthIdentityData = t2;", which is basically NULL. An aggressor script and a writeup (methodology) is coming soon.
